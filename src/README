Control utility for the 96board Console adapter

This program will control the power button and reset button signals when using a
96Boards USB console adaptor.

This is a very simple utility, but unfortunately it isn't very convenient
because it will disconnect the kernel driver from the UART adaptor when
twiddling the pins, which means the console connection gets lost. The kernel
driver needs to be reconnected by echoing the device address into the ftdi_sio
driver's 'bind' file in sysfs.

This program requires read/write access to the raw USB device in /dev/bus/usb/.
For convenience, a udev rule can be used to make the device group writable when
it is enumerated. Copy the file udev-rules/71-ftdi_sio.rules into
/etc/udev/rules.d

TODO:
- Let CBUS pins be manipulated without disconnecting the kernel driver

Prerequisites: libftdi-0.20 and libusb-0.1
There are much newer versions of those libraries, but v0.20 and v0.1 are
the versions packaged in Ubuntu. This program /should/ build against
newer versions, but I've not been able to test it yet. (In fact, I'd
really like to be using the latest libftdi because it adds proper FT230X
eeprom support and would let me reconnect the kernel driver
automatically, but that causes pain because v1.2 isn't packaged yet).

Building:
$ apt-get install libftdi-dev libusb-dev
$ make
