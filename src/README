Control utility for the 96board Console adapter

This program will control the power button and reset button signals when using a
96Boards USB console adaptor.

This is a very simple utility, but unfortunately it isn't very convenient
because it will disconnect the kernel driver from the UART adaptor when
twiddling the pins, which means the console connection gets lost. The kernel
driver needs to be reconnected by echoing the device address into the ftdi_sio
driver's 'bind' file in sysfs.

This program requires read/write access to the raw USB device in /dev/bus/usb/.
For convenience, a udev rule can be used to make the device group writable when
it is enumerated. Copy the file udev-rules/71-ftdi_sio.rules into
/etc/udev/rules.d

- Let CBUS pins be manipulated without disconnecting the kernel driver
